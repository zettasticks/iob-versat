// How does this work?

// Data that is carried directly from the units is set inside GenerateInitialInstanceInfo
// Data that is computed from graph / data that depends on other units is calculated inside FillInstanceInfo

// We currently just stuff everything into this struct, so it's easier to visualize all the info that we need for the current accelerator.
// Some of this data is duplicated/unnecessary, but for now we just carry on since this simplifies debugging a lot, being able to see all the info for a given accelerator directly.
// This approach is very slow but easier to debug since everything related to one unit is all in the same place.
// Until I find a better way of debugging (visualizing) SoA, this will stay like this for a while.

// TODO: Put some note explaining the required changes when inserting stuff here.

// TODO: IMPORTANT: A lot of this data is not properly handling parameters.
//       As an example, the mem mapped bits and all that stuff is not actually being influenced by the parameters
//       This means that a lot of this info does not change if we have different parameters or not to the units.
//       We are also getting "lucky" because some of the codeGeneration code is not actually using these values
//       when it should. We are essentially bypassing the logic that we have in here because the data that is 
//       calculated in here is not proper.

// NOTE: How to fix this? The way I see it is that the simplest way of doing this is to first do a pass where we
//       calculate all the values of the parameters globally. Meaning that if I have a unit instantiated with
//       unit #(.PARAM_A(5),.PARAM_B(PARAM_X)) and the module above has unit #(.PARAM_X(7)) then we 
//       have the values of the unit parameters being .PARAM_A = 5, .PARAM_B = 7.

//       After doing this first pass we can then calculated everything that requires parameters by making a 
//       a reference to these values.

// NOTE: Basically, 1) Instantiate everything, every unit knows what the final value of its parameter is.
//                  2) Calculate all the other stuff based on the "environment" of its parameters.
//                  3) All the codeGeneration data is provided from InstanceInfo meaning that if something is 
//                     miss calculated the problem is in here not in codeGeneration.cpp.


LEFT HERE - We changed parameters but we are going too far. Parameters like DATA_W should not be changed,
            they should remain global parameters that every module has access to but cannot change their meaning
            and the generated verilog depends on DATA_W.

            This also means that the user cannot define parameters whose name coincide with it but this is something
            that we can do later.

            Priority is to now test the changes, potentially change the codeGeneration code to use 
            data from AccelInfo and check if we solved the memMapped problem.

// nocheckin - A bunch of members have different purposes and we are not keeping track of it.
//             Some members are extracted directly from the inst so not important.
//             Some members are symbolic expressions because they might depend on parameters and such.
//             Some members are instantiation of symbolic expressions. These members only make sense 
//               for the final AccelInfo, the one used to generate the Verilog/C code.
//             Either we separate stuff into proper structures (which I do not like since I prefer to have
//               every in the same place) or we divide the members into groups according to how they are used
//               and put some comments explaining stuff.

Approach:

Push the parameter stuff to the AcceleratorInfo.
Make a function that iterates over the AcceleratorInfo and instantiates parameters.

From that point on everything that requires information uses it from an instantiated AcceleratorInfo.
The Circuits still output parameters, but the final product, the top level instance instantiates everything that is instantiated. The circuits are parameterized, the versat top level instance is not (unless we can sneak in a few stuff, as long as the software does not depend on it we can still provide it).

The only thing that needs parameters is the 

Change top level code generation function to use the instantiated values inside the AcceleratorInfo.

What problem are we trying to solve?

When an accelerator contains multiple merged units, we view it as a single partition that contains each unit activated to a single type.

If we have Module {A,B} where A = a | b and X = x | y, then we have 4 merge partitions: (a,x),(a,y),(b,x),(b,y).

Each partition contains two activated types at the same time. The first partition (a,x) contains the activated type a for the unit A and the activated type x for the unit B.

If a contains a user function and x contains a user function then this "partition" contains two user functions. One that activates the a side of the A unit and configures it and the other that activates the x side of the B unit and configures it.

Which means that:

  Activating one merge unit cannot change the activation of another merge unit. They need to be separated. 

Info that is tied to an unit is stored inside the InstanceInfo.
Info that is tied to a merge unit is stored inside each MergePartition.

What about info that is tied to a module?
If a module contains two merged units (of size 2) how do I save info that is tied to that unit?

The thing is that I can tie info to the unit by putting it into InstanceInfo.
  The problem is that we now have two ways of tying the UserConfig into units. The InstanceInfo and MergePartition way.

Maybe I can uplift this if we change ConfigFunctions to contain the merge index that is associated to. We can also have the struct contain the name of the unit instead of putting directly to it.

As long as the userFunctions can be instantiated for a given configuration 

For now, lets process to handle Composite units first and then we can tackle the merge stuff.
